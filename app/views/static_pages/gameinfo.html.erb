    <h2>What is GeoHunter?</h2>
    <p>
        GeoHunter is a browser game that allows you to experience exploring, without actually going out 
        into the world and explore. This game is a Turn-based Role Playing Game and the main goal of the game would be to acquire 
        as much experience points as possible and level up your character. These levels would represent the 
        player's score on a leaderboard. GeoHunterâ€™s main feature would be using your location to determine 
        what game maps are available for you to explore.
